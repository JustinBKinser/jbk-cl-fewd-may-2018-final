Code Louisville FEWD May 2018 Class Project

Simple multi-page site with embedded content, functional navbar, collapsing navbar on resize, hamburger menu and more. Unfortunately I couldn't get the hamburger menu to actually open up, but it does at least show upon resize. I kept running into issues getting the chicken document iframe to display on all browswers. I planned to replace it with boxes of Ispum Lorem using flexbox but ran out of time.
